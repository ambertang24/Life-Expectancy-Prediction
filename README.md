# Life-Expectancy-Prediction

This was my final year project in University studying Computer Science and it was one of the first big machine learning projects I did which involved a range of different models and using new techniques such as hyperparameter tuning. Overall I am happy with the projects outcome and the learning outcomes that came from it.


## Project Outline

In this project, factors of Life Expectancy are explored to understand the different attributes that can affect a countries Life Expectancy. The dataset used in this project is the 'Life Expectancy' datase from Kaggle which uses the World Health Organisation (WHO) data on different countries.

This Project involves three notebooks, One for Exploratory Data Analysis, One for the implementation of the Linear Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost model and a final notebook for the Deep Neural Network.
